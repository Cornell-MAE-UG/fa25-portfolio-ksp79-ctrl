2D Mechanism Design for Maximum Lift

In this project, I was tasked with designing a 2D lifting mechanism within a 150 cm by 50 cm design space using three pin supports, a rigid bar of chosen length, and a linear actuator selected from an online catalog. The objective was to develop a rigid-frame mechanism capable of lifting the maximum possible load to the highest possible height while respecting geometric and force limitations.

This problem required a blend of mechanical design, kinematic analysis, and structural reasoning. Key skills included:

Mechanism design and geometry optimization to determine bar placement and support configuration.

Statics and force analysis to ensure the system could handle maximum actuator loads efficiently.

CAD modeling and simulation to visualize motion and validate mechanical feasibility.

Engineering judgment in balancing lift height, force amplification, and structural stability.

Through this project, I strengthened my ability to translate abstract design constraints into a physically realizable and efficient lifting mechanism.
