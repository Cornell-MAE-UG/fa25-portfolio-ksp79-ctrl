# SLFilter **Team:** Yellowjackets **Client(s):** Cornell
CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape 
## Problem statement: #
When grapes are harvested by mechanised harvesters, spotted lanternflies are collected along with them. Up to 80% of the SLF on a vine can be removed from the vine and end up in the final product. SLF can move to grape vines immediately before harvesting, making it hard to prevent their accidental harvesting. 

**Impact:** Even a couple of SLF in a shipment can cause tons of grapes to be thrown out, so it is critical that they are removed at every stage of the harvest process in order to preserve the profits of the farm.

## Proposed Direction(s)

### Concept A: Airflow Distinguisher

**What it is:**  
An adjustable fan attached to the harvesting system that applies controlled airflow. The lighter SLF are blown away from the grapes into a separate container.

**How it would be used:**  
Immediately after harvesting and before the grapes enter the final container, the fan separates the lighter SLF from the grape collection.

### Concept B: Grate Accumulator

**What it is:**  
A specialized solution is sprayed onto harvested grapes and SLF to loosen their connection. The separated grapes fall through a custom-built grid into a chamber, blocking the larger SLF from following.

**How it would be used:**  
After harvest, the mixture is sprayed to loosen connections. The grapes are rolled onto a grid and filtration grate (similar to a honeycomb design), where the smaller grapes fall through.

### Why It’s Better Than the Status Quo (Both Concepts)

- Minimal labor required  
- Minimal modifications to existing harvesters  
- Designed as a set-and-forget attachment  

---

### End-of-Semester Proof-of-Concept

With available resources, we can prototype either concept.  
3D printing will allow us to test parameters like airflow, angle, hole spacing, and grate shape to evaluate performance.

### Key Risks & Unknowns

- **Yield damage:** Reduced yield could pose a systemic risk.
- **Harvesting practices:** Differences between handpicking and tractor harvesting affect modularity.
- **Limited access to real harvest conditions:** We lack direct observation of grape/SLF behavior during harvest.

### Questions for the Client

1. What does the current harvesting vehicle look like, and where is there space to implement a post-harvest separation device?  
   *Decision affected:* Final attachment and design integration.

2. What are the grapes and SLF like immediately after harvest and before shipping?  
   *Decision affected:* Simulation setup for prototype testing.

3. How does the grape inspection process work?  
   *Decision affected:* Evaluation metrics for prototype effectiveness.
