This is a system utilized in various applications in order to maximize power output of a combustion engine. The system is designed so that it utilizes the exhaust gasses' energy to power both low and high-powered turbochargers, with the low powered turbocharger's compressed air feeding into the high power turbocharger, which then compresses it further. This high-pressure output is then fed into the intercooler, which utilizes the outside air to cool the high pressure gasses, allowing them to become denser and thus push more air - and more oxygen - into the combustion chamber. More air, along with an input of more fuel allows for more power to be produced by the engine. These hot exhaust gasses are then fed into the "hot" side of the turbocharger, which is essentially a turbine whose work powers the initial compression of the intake-air. Overall, this system allows for more power to be harnessed from a given combustion engine by increasing the amount of oxygen and fuel within the cylinder during combustion. Notably, this additional power is achieved without increasing the size, and therefore weight, of the engine, ultimately allowing for a smaller engine to produce a power output which could normally only be achieved by a far larger and heavier engine.
