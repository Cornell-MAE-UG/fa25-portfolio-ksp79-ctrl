This system is used in internal combustion engine applications to increase power output without increasing engine size. It operates by recovering energy from the engine’s exhaust gases and converting it into useful shaft work through a two-stage turbocharging system. The exhaust gases expand through a high-pressure and low-pressure turbine, and the work produced by these turbines drives corresponding compressors on the intake side.

Ambient intake air is first compressed by the low-pressure compressor and then further compressed by the high-pressure compressor, increasing its pressure and temperature. The compressed air then passes through an intercooler, where heat is rejected to the surroundings at approximately constant pressure. This cooling increases the air density, allowing a greater mass of oxygen to enter the combustion chamber for a given volumetric flow rate.

The increased oxygen availability enables additional fuel to be combusted, resulting in greater engine power output. Importantly, this enhancement is achieved by utilizing energy that would otherwise be wasted in the exhaust stream, improving overall engine performance and power density without a proportional increase in engine mass or displacement. This makes multi-stage turbocharging with intercooling an effective strategy for engine downsizing while maintaining high performance.

Overall, this is a particularly interesting and helpful application of thermodynamic processes, as it enables combustion engines to gain far more power with just a relatively minor weight addition. This system is an exeptional example of how the devices we learned about in Thermodynamics fit real-world scenarios.
