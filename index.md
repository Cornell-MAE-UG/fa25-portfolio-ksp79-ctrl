## About Me

Hi! My name is Kevin and I’m from Wellesley, a town just outside Boston Massachusetts. I’m currently a freshman in my second semester at Cornell University College of Engineering and am planning on majoring in mechanical engineering. I grew up playing hockey, something I still enjoy to this day on the Cornell Club Hockey Team.  I have had a few experiences which awoke my interest in pursuing mechanical engineering as my future career. 

Firstly, during the COVID 19 pandemic I made the decision to embark on a nine month personal project building a motorized drift trike. This meant synthesizing many systems and components into a working vehicle. Additionally, I participated in summer programs for my summers going into junior and senior year of high school which were transformative in preparing me for college. The first, Economics for Leaders helped me work on team building and interpersonal communication skills, as well as learning about the decision making process within the study of economics. The second, a Tufts engineering program, taught me a lot about coding and also culminated in a final team project, with my team designing, fabricating, and coding a blackjack card counting robot within just a two day work period. This project helped me practice working in a team as well as time management. 

Finally, the project I’ve been most proud of I started the summer before senior year was a model prosthetic hand. It consisted of 3d printing designs I made in CAD, prototyping, and then eventually coding a program which would track my fingers and mirror my movements on the hand. I have also involved myself this semester in the Cornell University Mars Rover project team. Throughout my time with Mars Rover, I have enhanced valuable skills in CAD and have learned a lot about what it means to participate in a professional, well organized engineering organization. Overall, while I am still undecided on which industry I hope to pursue in the future, I hope to gain more knowledge in the field of mechanical engineering and pursue specific engineering interests which I hope to discover over my four years in Cornell engineering.
